# CascadeKit-iOS [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevintulod/CascadeKit-iOS/master/LICENSE)

CascadeKit is an iOS framework that introduces a new type of navigation controller for iPad apps. CascadeController is combines the navigational properties of UINavigationController with the contextual advantages of UISplitViewController.

CascadeKit is built entirely in Swift 3.

**Important Note:** CascadeKit is not fully functional and is actively developed on.

## Features

* A "cascading" view controller, implemented using a UIViewController container
* Combines the master/detail context of UISplitViewController, while allowing the end user to navigate forward and backward, similar to UINavigationController
* Ability to resize master/detail views by dragging the view divider
* Intuitive gestures to navigate back through the cascade stack

## Requirements

* iOS 10.0+ (for now)
* Xcode 8.0+ (Swift 3 support only)

## Usage

CascadeKit is still under active development and is not fully implemented.
